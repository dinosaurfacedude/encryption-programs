# encryption-programs
This is a collection of various encryption programs, as I am trying to learn more about the subject.
Ever since I was eight years old I have found secret codes fascinating, but outside of basic 
substitution ciphers, I never got far into my learning about them. This repository is my quest to learn
as much as possible about the ancient art of ciphers. As of right now, I have a double transposition cipher,
and a caesar cipher.
