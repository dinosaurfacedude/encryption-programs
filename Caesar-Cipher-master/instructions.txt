instructions:
This program is meant to be run in the command line. 
Open it with Python3 in the terminal/command line or in your favorite IDE, and choose whether you want to encrypt or decrypt.
If you choose to encrypt, type in the filepath of the file you need encrypted, and choose your numerical key.
The encrypted message will be stored in encrypted.txt.
I have it set so that you still have to type in the name of encrypted.txt, in case if its name gets changed.
